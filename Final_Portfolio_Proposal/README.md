I choose to work on my midterm project, there are several goals I want to achieve:
1. Learn bootstrap, manipulate and develop it for my final portfolio website
2. Complete my portfolio: include all details of each project in different area--include description, pictures, etc.
3. Add a javascript form that allow readers to type in, and contact my if appliable.
4. Fix bugs/improve design/develop more features of my website--make it more user friendly
5. More to consider while working on...
