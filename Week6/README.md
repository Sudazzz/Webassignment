<<<<<<< HEAD
The concept of my website is to develop my portfolio website. I prefer my website to be visual oriented since my professional interest is towards the visual aspect, which includes photography, films, and design. So there is not a lot of text on my website, words may only be used to describe my projects, contact information, and introduction to myself. I would like to create a multiple page website. I would like to create phone-based, computer-based, and laptop-based versions using @media. And I prefer to present my works vertically/horizontally when you scroll down, which like this website shows: https://www.pixpa.com/example/preview/?designid=215&url=https://www.luluandisabelle.com.
And people can click pictures to see more details about the project. 

Minimal style, basically black and white, in order to make work to stand out. And for the head and menu bar, I feel the title of my page should be in the center and the menu should be on the right side. I learned it is my ideal choice from this website: http://www.takashikawashima.com/.

I divide my website into 5 sections, which are <home, design, photography, film, contact>. And I have learnt how to use interactive functions (like hover, click), and how to frame my website. I also learned how to use google fonts in my website as well. 

For the skills I have not grasped yet, I would like to learn how to align different images horizontally (for my photography page) in other types of screens and how to insert video in the website. And I also need to learn how to create urls for each of my pages, since right now I have no url for other pages that I can switch to.
