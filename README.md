# Webassignment
The concept of my website is to develop my portfolio website. I prefer my website to be visual oriented since my professional interest is towards the visual aspect, which includes photography, films, and design. So there is not a lot of text on my website, words may only be used to describe my projects, contact information, and introduction to myself. I would like to create a multiple pages website, which means to use <nav> <a> function to switch from page to page. I would like to create phone-based, computer-based, and laptop-based versions using @media, so people can comfortably view my website in different situations. And I prefer to present my works one by one (vertically/horizontally alignment) when you scroll down, which like this website shows: https://www.pixpa.com/example/preview/?designid=215&url=https://www.luluandisabelle.com.
And people can click pictures to see more details about the project.
My website is like this and the color is right now black and white but I may change it later. And for the head and menu bar, I feel the title of my page should be in the center and the menu should be on the right side. I learned it is my ideal choice from this website: http://www.takashikawashima.com/.

I divide my website into 5 sections, which are <home, design, photography, film, contact>. And I have learnt how to use interactive functions (like hover, click), and how to frame my website. I also learned how to use google fonts in my website as well. 

For the skills I have not grasped yet, I would like to learn how to align different images horizontally (for my photography page) and how to insert video in the website. And I also need to learn how to create urls for each of my pages, since right now I have no url for other pages that I can switch to.
