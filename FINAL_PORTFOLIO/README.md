Process Documentation:

    For final project, based on my final portfolio presented, there are several steps towards the complete project:

        1.Not changing the layout of my home page; similarly, making my other linked, same level main pages (meaning the projects page like-photography page/film page/design page/etc.) to have the same layout as my original, midterm home page. --DONE at 5/1/2023

        2. Adjust my layout using bootstrap. Right now I changed break line/layout of the container/layout of images. --DONE BY 5/1/2023 (Working on more bootstrap after 5/1/2023)

        3. Using javascript to see the console in order to fix bugs, using javascript to create a contact form on "About" page. So people could potentially/ideally could contact me. --DONE at 5/1/2023

        4. For subpages of main pages, I choose to make each subpage(also each project) a similar layout for the sake of consistency, which includes the name/details/picture or video of the project. However, for the photography main page, because of the large amount of photos I need to post on, I create a second-layer subpage (cataloged by project) under the first-layer sub page(cataloged by year). And the second-layer projects will have their own project detail page like others. --Still working on until today

        5. For photography project, the layout will be like the "photography gallery" with some description and information; for film/sound music project, I will include Youtube video in each project page especially, including year/description/credits/idea/...; for the design project, I will include limited (approximately 1-3) photos/pictures to show the main content, and then include credits/year/gallery show/...; for about page, it is only about myself and contact form.--Still working on until today

        6. Lastly, check and review--bugs finding/leak filling time. --LAST DAY BEFORE SUBMIT

    Issues encountered:

        1. I bought a domain for my website and at the first, I did not know how to use the domain/housting a website. And after I uploaded all my material, I found out thet with the same code, although there is no bug in my local code while runninng, the html page cannot link to the css page I included. Therefore, I just copy my css code to html in <style>. And it solved problem.

        2. Organize my file may be: how to organize my image/first-layer html code file/subpage(second-layer) html file into different folder. 

        3. I really encounter creativity/code issue when I write my mobile media code--I am think about how to make the same material more user-friendly to mobile user(layout of website/change hover to click); and also what the design of my mobile layout.

    Explanation of Code:

        A. "input[type=submit]:hover":
            This line of code is interesting to me when I recheck it after I wrote it down. A small line but holds a lot of information for personally speaking: input, submit type, while hovering. 
                
        B. It is also interesting that Bootstrap itself could be modified, and included in several different ways. And it is more interesting that Bootstrap requires more external resource code while using some specific features.
            
        C. the process of thinking about/exploring different features is also interesting


    Issues & Learning:

        1. Use some javascript features like writing a form--label/form action stuff.

        2. I use HTML/CSS smoothly after midterm, so there are not a lot of issues with it. But since I am not familiar with bootstrap, I spend a lot of time studying/bug fixing/etc.

        3. Changes of layout and also the consistency of it. Because I have included several years project--the huge amount of projects websites have to be user friendly, easy to navigate. So I spend a lot of time dealing with it. And I tried to use the folded nav bar, but it did not work. So I categorized my website using project type/year/format for users to explore. 

    Next Step:
        1. I will continuing completing my portfolio--I still have a lot of projects that I have not included; my photography book;zoom in the photo

        3. For my domain website, I did not apply the "SSL Certificate". I will figure out what is it soon and may be get one;

        3. The javascript contact form in the about page right now did not return anything; I want to make it return the result and send it to me but do not know how to do it
